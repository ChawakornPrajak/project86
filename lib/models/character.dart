      describ:"Vladilena Milizé, shortened to Lena, is the female protagonist of the 86 -Eighty Six- series. She is the commander of Shinei Nouzen and the Spearhead Squadron, whom she communicates with via the long-distance communication device known as the Para-RAID. After the Spearhead Squadron's departure, she becomes known for demanding orders and highly competent leadership, earning the nickname of Bloody Reina among the Processors. She was later sent as the Republic of San Magnolia's representative for the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package, of which she is the tactical commander.\n"
      "\n"
      "Lena has the silver eyes and hair of a Celena. Lena typically wears the Republic Army's Prussian Blue and White female dress uniform. She also wears various dresses, ranging from an old-fashioned silk gown she wears within her family's estate to a black evening dress that resembled mourning clothes at the Lune Palace. After the departure of the Spearhead Squadron, she dyes a streak of red into her hair to remember them, and begins to wear a black-colored form of the dress uniform. She later reverts back to the standard uniform and would remove the streak of red, as requested by Shin. During the Strike Package's stay in the United Kingdom of Roa Gracia, she wore a white and blue coat above her uniform.\n"
      "\n"
      "Lena was born into the former noble household of Milizé. After an encounter with the Eighty-Six outside the Eighty-Five Sectors when she was 10, Lena dedicated herself to becoming a Handler to assist the Eighty-Six on the frontlines. Her determination resulted in her skipping multiple grades, graduating at the top of her class, and becoming a major at the young age of 16. In the military, she has a reputation for effectively leading the Juggernaut squadrons. She has excellent tactical ability and can analyze combat data to determine the Legion's reinforcement rates. Lena exhibits a disregard for social opinions she deems immoral or useless. Despite taunts and jeers from other Handlers who dislike her close relationship with the Processors under her command due to their belief that they are traitorous sub-humans, Lena maintains her daily communications and puts in an effort to develop closer bonds with her squadrons. She remains steadfast in her opinion that the Eighty-Six can no longer be viewed as traitors due to the Giadian Empire having assumed to have fallen. Her mother's focus on social status and bloodlines, as well as the insistence—that, as the daughter of the Milizé family, Lena should resign from the army and marry another noble—are disdainful to Lena. Lena believes that the war is far more important than trivialities regarding marriage and social standing. Such ignorance towards the war from citizens of the Republic annoys Lena, who has witnessed the cruelty that allows the people of the Eighty-Five Sectors to maintain their lifestyle. Lena's sheltered upbringing and her isolation from her peers due to her rapid advancement to become a Handler have resulted in her being naïve. She believes that she can spout her outlandish ideals to the Republic without the fear of her punishment. Lena can also be authoritative when necessary and can use unscrupulous methods—such as guilt-tripping, bribing, and using physical threats—to achieve an objective. Though she is educated in social etiquette, she lacks friends besides Annette because she has outstripped all other peers in terms of education. At the same time, her noble lifestyle gives her no chance to learn basic skills such as sewing.\n"

          "While she is mostly Adularia, as shown by her long silver-blue hair, the pale blue eyes she inherited from a distant Celesta ancestor condemned her to being discriminated against as an Eighty-Six. She is 170 cm tall and wears scavenged desert camouflage fatigues like the rest of Spearhead Squadron.Due to her mixed Adularia and Celena blood, she was physically abused in the concentration camps by other Eighty-Six.

      "Kurena's admiration for Shin has developed into affection, a topic her squadron often uses to tease her. The feelings are not mutual, since Shin has grown to view her as a little sister. Despite this, she is persistent in trying to help him and gain his attention.\n"

      "Frederica has the bloodred eyes of a Pyrope and the jet-black hair of an Onyx.

She occasionally wears a beige flight cap emblazoned with the Giadian emblem.\n"
      "\n"
      "Frederica is haughty and outspoken, as she had been raised to be the next in line for the Giadian throne. She articulates her speech maturely for someone her age, which often rubs others the wrong way. She is not afraid to argue her point and occasionally breaks protocol to get her way, such as when she snuck aboard Shinei's transport during a sortie. When she was younger, she participated in boyish activities such as tree climbing, much to her knight's chagrin. Due to her sheltered upbringing, Federica is eager to experience new things. For instance, she got excited by the sight of a pair of deer. Federica generally speaks in rather old-fashioned way; Shin notes that her parlance is similar to his mother's way of speaking.\n"

He is the leader of the Spearhead Squadron, as well as the default operations commander of the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package. Among the Eighty-Six, he is known as the Reaper of the Eastern Front. His ability to hear the voices of the Legion allows him to locate them without the use of detection systems.\n"
      "\n"
      "Shin has the bloodred eyes of a Pyrope and the jet-black hair of an Onyx. His pale features and slender physique are characteristic of the Giadian Empire's nobles. He is described to be rather handsome, attracting the attention of a few of his female comrades. Shin almost always wears a sky-blue scarf to conceal the jagged scar on his neck. He obtained this scarf from the captain of his first squadron. Before he was gifted the scarf, his scar was concealed by bandages. As the Spearhead Squadron's leader, he wears a desert camouflage uniform scavenged from an abandoned Republic military depot. He later switches to the Federacy's steel-colored panzer jacket uniform, but retains his blue scarf, removing it only for official meetings.\n"
      "\n"
      "Shin is an incredibly kind person, even after being wronged by so many people in his life. He considers himself to be at fault in the matter with his brother and believes he is the one that needs to apologize. Even after being ostracized and feared by the other Eighty-Six, Shin felt that it was his responsibility to shoulder the deaths of his comrades and let them pass peacefully into the afterlife. He had always been the only person left alive until he met Raiden Shuga. Thus, even after meeting a companion that could survive along side him, he always felt it was his duty as the survivor to silently carry the tags of the fallen to his final destination. Even once letting go of his fallen comrades on the border between San Magnolia and Giad, he still used his comrades' deaths as an excuse to return to the battlefield. Shin's ability to hear the voices of the Legion places enormous mental strain on him, even when he has become accustomed to listening to the constant wails of the dead. The weight of both his responsibilities and the effects of his ability have contributed to his stoic nature and lack of mirth. Despite that, he has a gentle side to him that usually comes out when interacting with Fido. His kindness also manifests in selflessness to an extreme degree. This is demonstrated in when he chooses to face the Shepherd alone to put his brother to rest, as well as when he forcibly takes control of the Spearhead Squadron's last Juggernaut and attempts to hold off the Legion so that the rest of his squadron can escape. Shin had a distinct lack of care for himself. He compared himself to the Legion, calling himself a ghost, aimless and wandering. Consequently, he often threw himself into dangerous situations without regard for his own safety, somehow surviving through luck and combat skill. This tendency grew worse once Shin had completed his mission of putting his brother to rest and losing his raison d'etre. Even once he reunited with Lena and was pulled out of his suicidal craze, he still could not fathom that he was allowed to be selfish. He believed he could live even without a future to look forward to, or happiness which he could call his own. When Lena asked him for a wish he wanted fulfilled, he couldn't think of anything. His answer in the end was to take Lena to the sea, which he admitted was probably different than what Lena's question had intended. Shin eventually did realize his feelings for Lena. Once he confessed them to her during their stay in the Alliance of Wald, he was noted to be free of the shackles of pride binding him to the Eighty-Sixth Sector. He now genuinely had a future to look forward to, as well as a new found attachment to the world and humanity.\n"

      "\n"
      "Raiden sports the greenish steel-colored hair and eyes of an Eisen. He towers over others with his height of 185 cm and his muscular physique. His facial features are described as sharply defined, exemplified by his scars: one above the right eyebrow and another on his left cheek. Like the other members of the Spearhead Squadron, he wore a desert camouflage combat uniform, although he seemed to like forgoing the jacket and simply wore the gray top. He later switched to the Federacy's steel-colored panzer jacket uniform.\n"
      "\n"
      "Raiden is the Spearhead Squadron's big brother; he is the emotional leader that Shin could never be. He is also called the squadron's mom, because of his skills in traditionally feminine areas such as cooking and sewing, coupled with his insistence to make sure everybody was alright. Raiden is not afraid to be confrontational and upfront. Whenever he has had a problem with anyone, he would tell it to their face without fear. This includes his captain, Shin, as they have had numerous fights over their time together. When he had first met Shin, Raiden was quick to snap and assault anyone who ticked him off, earning him the somewhat insulting Personal Name of Werhwolf. While he has mostly subsided in his hot temperament as he has matured, he still retains his foul mouth.\n"
